# Mastering QGIS Second Edition

To get the most from this code bundle, it is recommended that you install QGIS and 
follow the explanations. If you choose to do so, you will need a reasonably modern 
computer with access to the Internet to download and install QGIS, read the 
documentation, and install plugins. QGIS can run on Windows, Mac OS X, and many 
Linux distributions.
